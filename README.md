# Binary-classifiction-of-machine-failure
using classification model to predict the probabilty of machine failure
this project was a kaggle competition using classification models to predict the probability of machine failure for test dataset.

PROCESSES 
1. Data cleaning:
Data cleaning involves checking for irregularities and the readability of the data bu the machine. The data cleaning includes checking for missing values, the data types. in this data it was observed that there was a column that couldnt be read by the machine because it was a string data type. So values were changed to a numerical data. then some variable where dropped. Pipeline was used in the pre-processing

2. EDA
the dataset was explored by using pie chart to check out the number of 0's and 1's. The correlation was checked and it was visualised using heatmap.
